    desc: "Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates who belong to the class of Aves. They have wings and lay hard-shelled eggs i.e. they are oviparous. They have toothless beaked jaws and a high rate of metabolism. Birds have a heart that is 4-chambered and a light skeleton. There are varieties of birds that are found around the world. They measure from about 5.5 cm (bee hummingbird) to about 2.8 meters like an ostrich. There are many forms of birds and they are either perching or passerine types of birds mostly. Birds have feathers that vary according to the species. Elephant birds and moa birds which are now extinct were the birds that had no wings. Many birds have adapted themselves for swimming like those of water and seabirds. Birds have a common feature that resembles the dinosaurs with wings or theropods. They show resemblance to the ancient avialans like the archaeopteryx which were found around 160 million years ago.  The modern birds developed in the middle to late Cretaceous period according to scientific evidence.",

More than half of all mammals are rodents, a group that includes mice and squirrels.",
